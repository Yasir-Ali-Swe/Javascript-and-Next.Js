# Web Engineering Labs - 5th Semester

This repository is created to store and manage my weekly lab solutions for the **Web Engineering** course during my 5th semester of BS Software Engineering. 

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Organize all lab work in one place.
- Track progress over the semester.
- Share my work with others and keep a record for future reference.
